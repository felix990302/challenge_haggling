## Haggling

Let's say there are a book, two hats, and three balls. You and a partner have to decide how to split these objects between the two of you. To you, the book is worth $4, a ball $2, and the hats are worthless. The partner might value the same objects differently; you don't know their valuation, but you know that the total worth of all objects is the same as for you, in this case, $10.

You and the partner take turns making offers to each other about how to split the goods. On each turn, one can either accept the partner's offer (except on the very first turn), or make a counter-offer. The negotiations are limited to 5 rounds (that is, there can be up to 10 offers in total). If an agreement is reached, each of you receives the amount that their part of the goods is worth to them. If there is still no agreement after the last turn (that is, the last word is a counter-offer rather than acceptance), neither partner receives anything at all. The same happens if one of the partners walks away from the negotiations.

Here is how the negotiations might go:

1. **You:** I want the book and two balls; you get a ball and both hats.
2. **Other:** I don't accept. I want all the balls and a hat; you get the book and a hat.
3. **You:** I don't accept. I want the book and a ball; you get two balls and both hats.
4. **Other:** I accept.

Unknown to you, the partner's valuation was: $2 for a ball, $2 for a hat, nothing for a book. Your agreement brought $6 to you and $8 to your partner.

In general, there are two or more types of objects, and a positive number of objects of each type. Each type of object is worth some nonnegative integer to each partner. The total value of all objects for each of the partners is the same, although the particular valuations are, in general, different between the partners. A proposed split must distribute all objects between partners; individual objects cannot be partitioned.

Your goal is to write a script that tries to maximize the value of its deal.

### Solutions

A solution is a Node.js module with no dependencies. Its export must be a class with a constructor and a single method:

```javascript
module.exports = class {
    constructor(me, counts, values, max_rounds, log){
        ..
    }
    offer(o){
        ...
    }
}
```

An instance of this class is created once for a negotiation session. The constructor receives the following arguments:

* `me` is 0 if your turn is first, and 1 if your turn is second.
* `counts` is an array of integers, describing how many of each type of object there is. This array is between 2 and 10 elements long.
* `values` is an array of integers the same length as `counts`, describing how much every object is worth to you.
* `max_rounds` is the limit on the number of rounds in the negotiations; a round is two turns, one by each partner.
* `log` is a function which your code can call to output a message for debugging (`console.log` won't work).

The `offer` method is called each time when it's your turn. Its argument `o` is an array of integers the same size as `counts`, which describes how many of each type of object the partner offers to you. If your turn is first, and this is the first round, `o` is `undefined`.

The `offer` method should return `undefined` if you accept the offer (except when `o` is `undefined`). Otherwise, it should be an array of integers the same size as `counts`, describing how many of each type of object you want for yourself. Note that both the argument and the return value of `offer` describe the partition from *your* perspective, that is, what you get.

There is a timeout of 1 second per turn. If the code times out, throws an exception or returns an invalid value, it is regarded as walking away from the negotiations, and neither partner receives anything.

The module won't be allowed to learn, i.e. to keep any data persistent between sessions.

See [example.js](src/example.js) for a very simple example of a negotiation script. It will accept any offer that allows it to receive at least half of the total value; otherwise, it simply demands all items with nonzero value. It also demonstrates the use of the `log` function.

### Testing

The [haggle.js](src/haggle.js) script allows you to stage negotiations between two human agents, between a human and a script, and between two scripts. Run it with `--help` to see what it can do. You should run `npm install` in the `src` directory to install the required modules.

For fair and repeatable testing, the pseudo-random generator that determines the number of each type of object and their values for participants, will be initialized with fixed “seed” values (see `--seed` command-line option of `haggle.js`).

We are going to judge the contest by running negotiations pairwise between the submitted solutions. (Note that only the last solution submitted by each participant will be tested.) First, each possible pair of two distinct solutions, including (A, B) and (B, A) as two separate pairings, will be tested with each of *N* randomly chosen seeds. That is, a set of seeds will be selected randomly, but every pair will get to negotiate on each of them, and each solution will get to be the first and the second in each pair. Solutions will be ranked according to the total scores they accumulate during this stage (rather than the number of “wins”). Then, *K* solutions that ranked best, will enter the finals, where *M* additional randomly chosen seeds will be used to test all possible pairings within just the *K* best solutions. The final standings among the top *K* solutions will be determined by the scores accumulated in sessions with other finalists only. This way, we'll get to test the finalists more thoroughly (on *N*+*M* seeds), and discourage participants from submitting many weak solutions (“spoilers”) to help their primary solutions win. The exact values of *N*, *M* and *K* will be announced later, as they depend on the number of solutions submitted.

For the final testing, we will use the default parameters of the testing script, that is, 3 object types, up to 6 objects total, the total value for each partner $10, and a limit of 5 rounds. We recommend that solutions support all combinations of parameters that are allowed by the test script.

The testing will happen on Ubuntu 14.04 (amd64) on a [c3.large](https://aws.amazon.com/ru/ec2/instance-types/#c3) Amazon AWS instance, one pair another, with no other load on the machine.

Bugs reported by participants get fixed, watch the [changelog](src/CHANGELOG.md) for updates. Please include the log of the problematic session (use `--log` to obtain) when reporting a bug.

### Online negotiations

We are providing a server that lets your script negotiate with scripts of other participants. It works like a typical online game server: you connect to an “arena”, and the server pairs you with another participant who wants to play.

| Arena                                                                    | Object types | Max total objects | Total value | Rounds | Time per turn | URL                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------:| -----------------:| -----------:| -----: | -------------:| ------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`standard`](https://hola.org/challenges/haggling/scores/standard)       |            3 |                 6 |          10 |      5 |     unlimited | `wss://hola.org/challenges/haggling/arena/standard`    |
| [`standard_1s`](https://hola.org/challenges/haggling/scores/standard_1s) |            3 |                 6 |          10 |      5 |       1000 ms | `wss://hola.org/challenges/haggling/arena/standard_1s` |
| [`large`](https://hola.org/challenges/haggling/scores/large)             |            5 |                10 |          20 |      8 |     unlimited | `wss://hola.org/challenges/haggling/arena/large`       |
| [`large_1s`](https://hola.org/challenges/haggling/scores/large_1s)       |            5 |                10 |          20 |      8 |       1000 ms | `wss://hola.org/challenges/haggling/arena/large_1s`    |

The `standard_1s` arena has the settings that will be used in the final testing, while `standard` does not enforce the 1-second timeout to allow humans to participate. The `large` and `large_1s` arenas use a “larger” configuration just for fun.

Use `haggle.js` to connect to it either as a human agent or with your script. Specify the URL (from the last column of the table) on the command line alone or together with a script name.In this mode, the `--id` command-line option is required: it is a unique ID that will be used to track your scores. We recommend using your email address with a *constant* random string appended to it as the ID. **We won't publish this ID.**

Click the link in the first column of the table for machine-readable statistics; individual clients are identified by the *hash of their ID*. For every client, the statistics include how many sessions it has completed (`sessions`), in how many of them an agreement was reached (`agreements`), and the total score (`score`) during the entire time since this feature was introduced (`all`) or during a specific day (UTC).

The server and its statistics are purely for your information and entertainment. The scores achieved on the server will have no effect on the final standings, and you are not required to use the server at all. However, it can be a useful way to see where you stand, and to accumulate learning data to improve your script.

If you have a working script, we recommend running it repeatedly whenever your computer is powered on, such as with the following UNIX shell one-liner:

```
while true; do node haggle.js --id me@example.com:1234abcd myscript.js wss://hola.org/challenges/haggling/arena/standard; done
```

### Submitting your solution

Please submit your solutions using [this form](https://hola.org/challenges/haggling). We don't accept submissions by email.

Some solutions might contain code or data that is generated, minified or translated from another language; in such cases, we require that the source code be submitted as well. If the code or data is generated, please include the generator; if it's minified, include the original version; if it's compiled from a different language such as CoffeeScript, include the original code. We also appreciate if you include a brief README file with some explanation of your approach (in English). Please submit the above as a tar.gz, tar.bz2, or zip archive. The contents of this archive will be published, but won't be tested.

We have set the maximum size of the submitted script (not including the source archive) to 64 MiB. This is an arbitrary number chosen simply to prevent someone from filling our disks with a single submission. If your solution is legitimately bigger than 64 MiB, please take contact, and we'll make a reasonable increase.

If you have questions about this problem statement, or trouble submitting your solution, please contact challengejs@hola.org.

**Good luck to all the participants!**
